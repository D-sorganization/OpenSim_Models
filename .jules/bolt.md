## 2026-04-21 - Numpy Overhead on Scalars
**Learning:** In a codebase making extensive use of physics properties, `numpy.asarray` and universal functions like `numpy.isfinite` have significant overhead when called on scalar values (floats/ints). This became a bottleneck in core geometry construction functions (e.g. `cylinder_inertia`) that run thousands of times.
**Action:** When validating mathematical inputs via design-by-contract preconditions, implement a fast-path for native Python scalars using the `math` module (e.g., `math.isfinite()`) before falling back to `numpy` for arrays.
